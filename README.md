# Estimation of human age using machine learning on panoramic radiographs for Brazilian patients - DATASET

Guide for accessing the database of panoramic radiographs used in research on estimating human age through machine learning, focused on Brazilian patients.

This full dataset consists of 12827 dental panoramic X-ray images, some of them are from the same person, but we will provide hashed data to acess a single image from 10036 unique patients. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Local Research Ethics Committee, University of Pernambuco, Brazil (CAAE 42878921.6.0000.5208).
